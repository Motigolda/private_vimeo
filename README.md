In my degree studies, i have to watch some lectures at my college website.
For the porpuse of saving the college lectures, they've uploaded their lectures to vimeo private videos.
When i want to watch the lectures on the ways or just to rewind or look forward, the video getting stuck, and not to mention the very specific speed rates that included in the video-player. 
----
Because of that, I needed a solution that help me to download the video. 
I've watched a youtube video that explains how to download private vimeo video, and putted this into a script that helps me to automate the procedure.

Another important feature is the letcure-viewer, which provides me the option to watch the video in any speed rate i just want. 
In addition, in this viewer I can choose the wanted duration for a video, and the viewer selects automaticly the relevant speed-rate.
The lecture-viewer can be downloaded as a html template, or to be used in the wrapping python classes, that can be downloaded in be use.
Check it out in the lecture-viewer repo.
